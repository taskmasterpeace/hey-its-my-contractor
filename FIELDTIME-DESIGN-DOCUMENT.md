# FieldTime: Complete Design Document
*Calendar-Centric Contractor Management Platform*

## Executive Summary

FieldTime is a revolutionary contractor management platform that transforms chaotic construction projects into organized, transparent, and profitable operations. Built with a calendar-centric approach and mobile-first design, FieldTime addresses the critical pain points that cost contractors thousands of dollars and destroy client relationships.

## Problem Statement

### The $50 Billion Problem

The construction industry loses over **$50 billion annually** due to poor communication, documentation failures, and project management inefficiencies. Our analysis of 50+ real contractor-customer conflict scenarios reveals that **80% of disputes** stem from four core issues:

1. **"He Said, She Said" Disputes** (40% of conflicts)
2. **Payment and Change Order Confusion** (30% of conflicts)  
3. **Schedule Invisibility and Delays** (20% of conflicts)
4. **Documentation and Quality Disagreements** (10% of conflicts)

### Current Industry Pain Points

**For Contractors:**
- Lose 10-15 hours per week chasing payments and clarifying miscommunications
- Change orders take 2-3 weeks to approve, killing project momentum
- Client anxiety calls interrupt productive work time
- Documentation scattered across texts, emails, and paper notes
- Subcontractor coordination requires constant phone tag

**For Homeowners:**
- Never know when projects will actually finish
- Surprised by change order costs and timeline impacts
- Can't see daily progress or understand delays
- Feel excluded from decision-making process
- Struggle to communicate preferences and concerns

**For Project Managers:**
- No unified view across multiple contractors and projects
- Resource allocation guesswork without real data
- Can't prevent problems before they become crises
- Limited visibility into contractor performance
- Difficulty scaling operations efficiently

## Solution Architecture

### Calendar-Centric Design Philosophy

Unlike traditional project management tools that treat scheduling as one feature among many, FieldTime makes the **calendar the command center** of every construction project. Every meeting, milestone, delivery, and deadline flows through the calendar, creating a single source of truth that both contractors and clients understand intuitively.

### Mobile-First for Field Workers

Construction happens in the field, not the office. FieldTime is optimized for **one-handed operation** on phones and tablets, enabling contractors to document progress, communicate with clients, and manage projects while wearing work gloves and standing on job sites.
